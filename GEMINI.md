Always respect the 'openspec' commands and follow their instructions closely.

When creating 'tasks.md' file for the proposed change, be sure to use the
markdown format for each todo, like this:

```markdown
- [ ] **Write down a task**. Each task should be formatted properly
```

If there's a 'tasks.md' in one of the 'openspec' subfolders that corresponds to
the change currently being implemented, use it to track the todos. Check off
each item in that list upon completion.
